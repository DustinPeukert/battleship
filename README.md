Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
 - Thought about the missing pieces to the game of battlship. Such as the CPU and the player classes. Even though weren't able to we had plans to create a game class as well. Due to time we prioritized getting a working version of battleship.

If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
 - First we would add a game class and turn class. After we would add in more edge cases. 

Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
 - driver/navigator(all of iteration one)
    - once class each as driver, one class each as navigator.
 - divide and conquer(iteration 2, beginning of iteration 3)
    - split up board creation and features between the two of us.
    - split up the cpu and player classes/specs files.
        - would notify each other when we have completed our respective tasks. 
 - ping pong(runner file)
    - Using the extension "Live Share" we ping ponged as we worked through making the runner file.

Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
    - We used constructive criticism, and had open communication throughout the project. Mostly through zoom, but also communicated through comments in github.
    - we had established through the DTR, to be respectful to each other as well as being vulnerable and open feedback.
